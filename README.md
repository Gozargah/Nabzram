# Nabzram

</div>

<div align="center">

*A Marzban client tool for connecting to Marzban subscriptions, born out of pure boredom and built with whatever tech stack was lying around* ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

</div>

> This entire project, including the logo, components, app architecture, and even this README you're reading right now, was crafted by AI. Well, except the name "Nabzram" - that was my brilliant idea! üòÆ‚Äçüí® I was bored one day, had some subscriptions to use, and thought "why not?" So here we are - a desktop app that actually does exactly what it needs to do, and it works!

A modern GUI application for managing and connecting to **Marzban subscription servers**. Built with Python and React, wrapped in a native desktop application using pywebview.

> **Important**: This app is made specifically for Marzban subscriptions. It runs Xray-core and exposes SOCKS/HTTP proxies to your system. **System-wide proxy configuration is now supported** - TUN interface is not yet implemented.

## Build from Source

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.12+**
- **UV**: For managing Python versions and dependencies
- **Xray-core**: Optional - app will download it for you if not found
- **Bun**: For frontend development (recommended) or Node.js

**Supported Platforms**: Windows, macOS, and Linux

### System Dependencies

#### Linux (Ubuntu/Debian)
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  pkg-config build-essential python3-dev \
  libcairo2-dev libgirepository1.0-dev \
  libgtk-3-dev libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev
```

#### Windows
- No additional system dependencies required
- Xray-core will be automatically downloaded if not found

#### macOS
- No additional system dependencies required
- Xray-core will be automatically downloaded if not found

### Install Xray-core (Optional)

The app can automatically download Xray-core if not found, but you can also install it manually:

#### Linux
```bash
# Download and install Xray-core
bash <(curl -L https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-install/raw/main/install-release.sh)
```

#### Windows
- Download from [Xray releases](https://github.com/XTLS/Xray-core/releases)
- Or let Nabzram download it automatically

#### macOS
```bash
# Using Homebrew
brew install xray

# Or download manually from releases
```

**Note**: If Xray-core is not installed, the app will prompt you to download it automatically on first run.

### Install UV

Follow instructions at [astral.sh/uv](https://astral.sh/uv/)

### Python Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/gozargah/nabzram.git
   cd nabzram
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

3. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   uv run main.py
   ```

## Development

### Frontend Development

The frontend is built with React, TypeScript, and Vite:

```bash
cd ui
bun install
bun run dev
```

The development server will start on `http://localhost:5173` and automatically reload on changes.

### Backend Development

The backend uses a modular architecture with operations and services:

```bash
# Run the main application
uv run main.py

# The application uses pywebview to create a native desktop window
# No separate server process needed - everything runs in the main process
```

**Note**: The application uses pywebview's built-in HTTP server for the frontend-backend communication.

### Building Executable

Build a standalone executable using Nuitka:

```bash
uv run build.py
```

This will:
1. Build the React frontend using Vite
2. Compile the Python application with Nuitka
3. Create a single executable file in the `dist/` directory

The build script automatically handles:
- Frontend dependency installation and building
- Nuitka installation if not present
- Platform-specific optimizations (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Icon and asset bundling

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Copy `env.example` to `.env` and modify as needed:

```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Available options:
- `DATABASE_PATH`: Database file location (default: user data directory)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug mode (default: false)

### Settings

Configure the application through the Settings modal:
- **Xray Binary Path**: Custom path to Xray executable
- **Assets Folder**: Xray assets directory
- **SOCKS Port**: Default SOCKS proxy port
- **HTTP Port**: Default HTTP proxy port

## Usage

### Adding Marzban Subscriptions

1. Click the **"+"** button to add a new subscription
2. Enter a name and your Marzban subscription URL (must support `/v2ray-json` endpoint)
3. The app will automatically fetch and parse server configurations
4. Servers will appear in the subscription list

### Connecting to Servers

1. Select a subscription to view its servers
2. Click on a server to connect
3. Monitor connection status and logs
4. Use the disconnect button to stop the connection

**Note**: Connections expose SOCKS and HTTP proxies to your system. You'll need to configure your applications to use these proxies manually - no system-wide proxy or TUN interface is configured.

## Architecture

### Backend (Python)
- **PyWebview**: Desktop application wrapper with built-in HTTP server
- **TinyDB**: Local database for subscriptions and settings
- **Xray-core**: Proxy protocol implementation

### Frontend (React)
- **React 19**: UI framework
- **TypeScript**: Type safety
- **Vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling (via CDN)
